It's year 2022, and it's the fifth year that oreos have disappered from the 
surface of the planet. Schnitzelburg, who's so keen on eating oreos, has been
searching for traces of oreos in our solor system. Sadly, he hasn't been able 
to find any. Well, not until today. Today, Schnitzelburg observed what could
be the first shadow of oreos humans have ever seen for the last five years.
	
While Schnitzelburg was working at milk factory today, he saw a piece of black
cookie floating in a glass of X-729, the lastest -20% fat milk designed by 
their top engineer, an old lady who's trying to lose weight before she die. 
At the moment Schnitzelburg saw the cookie, he realized that the cookie had 
something to do with the missing oreos. That's probably a piece from the 
orginal oreo that humans had been searched for years. But why? Why is it 
floating in X-729? What is the secrete beind the "weight losing milk"?
Schnitzelburg decided to seek into Pausliztrazik,the old lady's office.
There might be a bag of oreos that can be shared for several generations 
between the citizens in the world. So the children of the earth will know 
how decilious the oreo is. This was a mission that Schnitzelburg couldn't
fail.
